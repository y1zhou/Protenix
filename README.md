We’re excited to introduce **Protenix** — Toward High-Accuracy Open-Source Biomolecular Structure Prediction.

Protenix is built for high-accuracy structure prediction. It serves as an initial step in our journey toward advancing accessible and extensible research tools for the computational biology community.

## 🌟 Related Projects
- **[PXDesign](https://protenix.github.io/pxdesign/)** is a model suite for de novo protein-binder design built on the Protenix foundation model. PXDesign achieves 20–73% experimental success rates across multiple targets — 2–6× higher than prior SOTA methods such as AlphaProteo and RFdiffusion. The framework is freely accessible via the Protenix Server.

- **[PXMeter](https://github.com/bytedance/PXMeter/)** is an open-source toolkit designed for reproducible evaluation of structure prediction models, released with high-quality benchmark dataset that has been manually reviewed to remove experimental artifacts and non-biological interactions. The associated study presents an in-depth comparative analysis of state-of-the-art models, drawing insights from extensive metric data and detailed case studies. The evaluation of Protenix is based on PXMeter.

- **[Protenix-Dock](https://github.com/bytedance/Protenix-Dock)**: Our implementation of a classical protein-ligand docking framework that leverages empirical scoring functions. Without using deep neural networks, Protenix-Dock delivers competitive performance in rigid docking tasks.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🛠 Quick Installation

```bash
pip install protenix
```

To install the development version, use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/y1zhou/Protenix
cd Protenix
uv sync --extra cu128  # or cu130, based on your CUDA version
```

Note that with this installation method, you should prefix all following calls with `uv run <--extra ...>`,
e.g. for `protenix pred` you should use `uv run --extra cu128 protenix pred ...`.

### 🧬 Quick Prediction

```bash
# Predict structure using a JSON input
protenix pred -i examples/input.json -o ./output -n protenix_base_default_v1.0.0
```

### 🧪 Score Existing Structures (ProtenixScore)

If you have the external `protenixscore` package installed, you can score
existing PDB/CIF structures without running diffusion by using the confidence
head on provided coordinates:

```bash
# score a single structure
protenix score --input examples/7pzb.cif --output ./score_out

# score a directory of PDB/CIF files (recursively)
protenix score --input ./structures --output ./score_out --recursive
```

### 📊 Benchmark

#### Protenix-v2

Protenix-v2 (refers to the `protenix-v2` model) shows clear gains on antibody-antigen structure prediction, together with an additional update in ligand-related plausibility. Compared to baselines and the earlier Protenix-v1, Protenix-v2 demonstrates a substantial improvement trend. At the DockQ > 0.23 threshold, Protenix-v2 achieves absolute success rate gains of 9 to 13 percentage points over Protenix-v1 across three collections. Remarkably, Protenix-v2 at only 5 seeds already exceeds the performance of Protenix-v1 at 1000 seeds, indicating a clear gain in efficiency.

#### Protenix-v1

Protenix-v1 (refers to the `protenix_base_default_v1.0.0` model), the first fully open-source model that outperforms AlphaFold3 across diverse benchmark sets while adhering to the same training data cutoff, model scale, and inference budget as AlphaFold3. For challenging targets, such as antigen-antibody complexes, the prediction accuracy of Protenix-v1 can be further enhanced through inference-time scaling – increasing the sampling budget from several to hundreds of candidates leads to consistent log-linear gains.
