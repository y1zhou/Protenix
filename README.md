We’re excited to introduce **Protenix** — Toward High-Accuracy Open-Source Biomolecular Structure Prediction.

Protenix is built for high-accuracy structure prediction. It serves as an initial step in our journey toward advancing accessible and extensible research tools for the computational biology community.

## 🌟 Related Projects
- **[PXDesign](https://protenix.github.io/pxdesign/)** is a model suite for de novo protein-binder design built on the Protenix foundation model. PXDesign achieves 20–73% experimental success rates across multiple targets — 2–6× higher than prior SOTA methods such as AlphaProteo and RFdiffusion. The framework is freely accessible via the Protenix Server.

- **[PXMeter](https://github.com/bytedance/PXMeter/)** is an open-source toolkit designed for reproducible evaluation of structure prediction models, released with high-quality benchmark dataset that has been manually reviewed to remove experimental artifacts and non-biological interactions. The associated study presents an in-depth comparative analysis of state-of-the-art models, drawing insights from extensive metric data and detailed case studies. The evaluation of Protenix is based on PXMeter.

- **[Protenix-Dock](https://github.com/bytedance/Protenix-Dock)**: Our implementation of a classical protein-ligand docking framework that leverages empirical scoring functions. Without using deep neural networks, Protenix-Dock delivers competitive performance in rigid docking tasks.

## 🎉 Latest Updates

- **2025-11-05: Protenix-v0.7.0 Released** 🚀
  - Introduced advanced diffusion inference optimizations: Shared variable caching, efficient kernel fusion, and TF32 acceleration. See our [performance analysis](./assets/inference_time_vs_ntoken.png).
- **2025-07-17: Protenix-Mini & Constraint Features**
  - Released lightweight model variants ([Protenix-Mini](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11839)) that drastically reduce inference costs with minimal accuracy loss.
  - Added support for [atom-level contact and pocket constraints](docs/infer_json_format.md#constraint), enhancing prediction accuracy through physical priors.
- **2025-01-16: Pipeline Enhancements**
  - Open-sourced the full [training data pipeline](./docs/prepare_training_data.md) and [MSA pipeline](./docs/msa_template_pipeline.md).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🛠 Quick Installation

```bash
pip install protenix
```

### 🧬 Quick Prediction

```bash
# Predict structure using a JSON input
protenix pred -i examples/input.json -o ./output -n protenix_base_default_v1.0.0
```

### 🧪 Score Existing Structures (ProtenixScore)

If you have the external `protenixscore` package installed, you can score
existing PDB/CIF structures without running diffusion by using the confidence
head on provided coordinates:

```bash
# score a single structure
protenix score --input examples/7pzb.cif --output ./score_out

# score a directory of PDB/CIF files (recursively)
protenix score --input ./structures --output ./score_out --recursive
```

#### Key Model Descriptions
| Model Name | MSA | RNA MSA | Template | Params | Training Data Cutoff | Model Release Date |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `protenix_base_default_v1.0.0` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 368 M | 2021-09-30 | 2026-02-05 |
| `protenix_base_20250630_v1.0.0` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 368 M | 2025-06-30 | 2026-02-05 |
| `protenix_base_default_v0.5.0` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | 368 M | 2021-09-30 | 2025-05-30 |

- **protenix_base_default_v1.0.0**: Default model, trained with a data cutoff aligned with AlphaFold3 (2021-09-30).
  > 💡
  > This is the **highly recommended** model for conducting fair, rigorous public benchmarks and comparative studies against other state-of-the-art methods.
- **protenix_base_20250630_v1.0.0**: Applied model, trained with an updated data cutoff (2025-06-30) for better practical performance. This model can be used for practical application scenarios.
- **protenix_base_default_v0.5.0**: Previous version of the model, maintained primarily for backward compatibility with users who developed based on v0.5.0.

For a complete list of supported models, please refer to [Supported Models](docs/supported_models.md).

For detailed instructions on installation, data preprocessing, inference, and training, please refer to the [Training and Inference Instructions](docs/training_inference_instructions.md). We recommend users refer to [inference_demo.sh](inference_demo.sh) for detailed inference methods and input explanations.


### 📊 Benchmark

**Protenix-v1 (refers to the `protenix_base_default_v1.0.0` model)**, the first fully open-source model that outperforms AlphaFold3 across diverse benchmark sets while adhering to the same training data cutoff, model scale, and inference budget as AlphaFold3. For challenging targets, such as antigen-antibody complexes, the prediction accuracy of Protenix-v1 can be further enhanced through inference-time scaling – increasing the sampling budget from several to hundreds of candidates leads to consistent log-linear gains.
